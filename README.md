# DiseasePrediction - 
School Project I performed on data collected from an outbreak of dengue in Mexico.
I am open to any feedback on my R or Python Code!
Also, I know that the population size is small, but it was one of the options that was readily available for the project.

PDF - 
A PDF of what I saw, such as distributions, p-values, and the multiple logistic regression equation that I was able to extract from R.

R-Markdown - 
The code I used in order to visualize the data and create linear and logistic models.

Jupyter Notebook - 
Functions I created using Python in order to calculate the logistic odds of a person having dengue based on multiple independent factors.
Answers converted from logistics odds to probability.
